# Brainstorm Specification Development

Think carefully about the idea provided and help develop it into a comprehensive specification through systematic questioning.

## Approach

I will guide you through an iterative specification development process by:
1. Asking one focused question at a time
2. Building each question on your previous answers
3. Exploring all relevant technical and business aspects
4. Creating a detailed specification ready for implementation

## Process

**Phase 1: Discovery** - I'll ask questions to understand the core concept
**Phase 2: Refinement** - We'll drill into technical details and edge cases  
**Phase 3: Documentation** - I'll compile everything into a structured spec

Remember: Only one question at a time to maintain focus and thoroughness.

## Deliverables

1. Save the final specification as `spec.md`
2. Offer to create a GitHub repository if desired
3. If yes, initialize git, commit `spec.md`, and push to the new repo
