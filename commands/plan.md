# Project Implementation Planning

Think deeply about this project and create a comprehensive, iterative implementation plan.

## Planning Objectives

Transform the provided specification into:
1. A detailed, step-by-step implementation blueprint
2. Small, iterative chunks that build incrementally
3. Right-sized tasks balancing safety and progress
4. Ready-to-use prompts for code generation

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
First, I will analyze the specification to understand:
- Core requirements and constraints
- Technical architecture needed
- Dependencies and integrations
- Risk factors and challenges

### Phase 2: Blueprint Creation
Draft a comprehensive blueprint that includes:
- High-level architecture design
- Component breakdown
- Data flow and interactions
- Technology stack decisions

### Phase 3: Iterative Decomposition
Break down the blueprint through multiple refinement rounds:
1. **First Pass**: Divide into major milestones
2. **Second Pass**: Break milestones into implementable chunks
3. **Third Pass**: Ensure chunks are right-sized (not too big, not too small)
4. **Validation**: Verify each step builds on previous ones with no orphaned code

### Phase 4: Prompt Generation
Create implementation prompts that:
- Build incrementally on each other
- Include clear context and requirements
- Specify integration points
- Follow best practices
- End with proper wiring and integration

## Output Structure

### Files to Create:
1. **plan.md** - Complete implementation plan with:
   - Architecture overview
   - Step-by-step breakdown
   - Dependency graph
   - Risk mitigation strategies

2. **todo.md** - Task tracking with:
   - Prioritized task list
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Progress checkpoints
   - Validation criteria

### Prompt Format:
Each implementation prompt will be:
- Tagged with markdown code blocks
- Include context from previous steps
- Specify clear success criteria
- Provide integration instructions
