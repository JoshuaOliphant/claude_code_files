Here is the documentation for Claude Code hooks https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide and I have my own hooks set up in the @hooks/ directory. You can see that the hooks are set up to output logs inot this @logs/ directory, each file corresponds to a different hook. Here is my big question; what value can I derive from capturing these logs? Here are some initial thoughts that I have:
- I use custom slash commands which are defined in @commands/ directory, there is documentation here https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands. Can I use the chat log history in different projects to generate better commands? For example, these are the logs for another project /Users/joshuaoliphant/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/python_workspace/digital_garden/logs
- I have subagents defined in this directory @agents/ and the documentation is here https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents, maybe these logs can drive better agent prompts?
I want you to ultrathink about this problem. You may want to use subagents to do parallel research into different aspects of this problem. I want you to come up with at least 10 ideas. An example that comes to mind is that maybe a subagent could be used to iterate on the hooks, agents, or commands as I work? Or a seperate Claude Code instnace could run periodically to do this? Feel free to search the web for additional agents, context7 mcp is a great resource for documentation as well. You can kick of parallel subagents to help you research or think through different scenarios and then combine the results, etc.
