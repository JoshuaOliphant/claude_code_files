# Claude Code Hook Log Analysis System Design

## Problem Analysis

### Core Problem Statement
The Claude Code system generates extensive hook logs across multiple projects, but lacks intelligent analysis capabilities to:
1. Automatically identify performance bottlenecks in slash commands and agents
2. Detect patterns that indicate prompt improvements needed
3. Learn from successful interactions across projects to enhance system performance
4. Provide real-time feedback for iterative improvement

### Key Constraints and Requirements
- Must work with existing hook infrastructure without disrupting current workflows
- Should leverage logs from `/Users/joshuaoliphant/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/python_workspace/digital_garden/logs`
- Need to maintain privacy and security of log data
- Must provide actionable insights, not just raw analytics
- Should integrate seamlessly with current Claude Code commands and agents

### Dependencies Identified
- Current hook logging system (post_tool_use.py, user_prompt_submit.py, etc.)
- Existing agents and commands structure
- Cross-project log aggregation capabilities
- Machine learning pipeline for pattern recognition
- Real-time monitoring infrastructure

## Approach Evaluation

### Approach 1: Centralized ML Analytics Platform
**Description**: Build a comprehensive ML platform that ingests all logs, applies various algorithms, and provides dashboards.
**Pros**: 
- Comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Scalable to large datasets
- Can apply sophisticated ML techniques
**Cons**:
- Complex to implement and maintain
- May be overkill for current needs
- Risk of over-engineering

### Approach 2: Incremental Hook-Based Analysis
**Description**: Extend current hook system with lightweight analysis modules that process logs in real-time.
**Pros**:
- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Immediate feedback loops
- Easier to implement and test
**Cons**:
- May miss complex cross-session patterns
- Limited by real-time processing constraints

### Approach 3: Hybrid Event-Driven Architecture
**Description**: Combine real-time hook analysis with batch processing for deeper insights, using event-driven patterns.
**Pros**:
- Best of both approaches
- Scalable and maintainable
- Allows for both immediate and deep analysis
**Cons**:
- More complex initial setup
- Requires careful coordination between components

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Event-Driven Architecture
This approach provides the flexibility needed for both immediate feedback and deep learning from logs. It builds incrementally on the existing system while allowing for sophisticated analysis capabilities.

    def __init__(self, event_type, session_id, timestamp, data, metrics=None):
        self.event_type = event_type  # 'tool_use', 'prompt_submit', 'command_exec', etc.
        self.session_id = session_id
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data  # Original log data
        self.metrics = metrics or {}  # Performance metrics
        self.project_context = self._extract_project_context()
    
    def emit(self):
        # Send to both local logs and analysis pipeline
        LocalLogWriter.write(self)
        AnalysisPipeline.ingest(self)
```

            'success_patterns': SuccessPatternDetector()
        }
    
    def analyze(self, event):
        results = {}
        for name, detector in self.patterns.items():
            results[name] = detector.detect(event)
        return results
```

### 3. Cross-Project Learning System

    def __init__(self, global_logs_path):
        self.global_logs_path = global_logs_path
        self.pattern_db = PatternDatabase()
        self.recommendation_engine = RecommendationEngine()
    
    def learn_from_all_projects(self):
        # Process logs from digital_garden/logs and other projects
        for project_logs in self.discover_project_logs():
            patterns = self.extract_patterns(project_logs)
            self.pattern_db.update(patterns)
        
        # Generate recommendations based on learned patterns
        return self.recommendation_engine.generate_recommendations()
```

    def apply_insights(self, analysis_results):
        # Automatically suggest improvements to commands
        command_suggestions = self.command_optimizer.optimize(analysis_results)
        
        # Suggest agent prompt improvements
        agent_suggestions = self.agent_optimizer.optimize(analysis_results)
        
        # Generate prompt optimization suggestions
        prompt_suggestions = self.prompt_optimizer.optimize(analysis_results)
        
        return {
            'commands': command_suggestions,
            'agents': agent_suggestions,

            PerformanceAnalyzer(),
            ErrorAnalyzer(),
            SuccessAnalyzer()
        ]
    
    async def process_stream(self):
        async for event in self.stream:
            # Real-time analysis
            for analyzer in self.analyzers:
                result = await analyzer.analyze(event)
                if result.requires_action():
                    await self.trigger_action(result)
```

#### Alert System
- Performance degradation alerts (commands taking >2x normal time)

        self.failure_patterns = FailurePatternDatabase()
    
    def optimize_prompt(self, current_prompt, context):
        # Analyze current prompt against success/failure patterns
        issues = self.failure_patterns.detect_issues(current_prompt)
        improvements = self.success_patterns.suggest_improvements(current_prompt, context)
        
        return {
            'issues_found': issues,
            'suggested_improvements': improvements,
            'confidence_score': self.calculate_confidence(issues, improvements)
        }
```

#### Command Performance Optimizer
```python
class CommandOptimizer:
    def analyze_command_performance(self, command_logs):
        # Identify slow commands and suggest optimizations
        performance_metrics = self.extract_performance_metrics(command_logs)
        bottlenecks = self.identify_bottlenecks(performance_metrics)
        optimizations = self.suggest_optimizations(bottlenecks)
        
        return {
            'current_performance': performance_metrics,
            'bottlenecks': bottlenecks,
            'optimizations': optimizations
        }
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Workflows
